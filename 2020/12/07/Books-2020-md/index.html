        <p>✨<strong>Brave New World(Aldous Huxley)</strong></p>
<!-- restlessness and exhaustion This quote was my favorite at my first time reading this book: "But I don’t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."  shout out Does excessive freedom murder people's free mind?
1984对比 极致的压迫和过度的自由 你要哪一个呢 All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny生活在两种
这半年呢 放纵又孤独 不想要情感上的东西 feel so lost after gettinf sober from alcohol  -->
<p>✨<strong>Being Mortal(Atul Gawande)</strong><br><!--为什么要读这本书呢，我经历过亲人的离开，身边朋友的离去， 我没有勇气面对这些离别，想要找到一些慰藉。
死亡是一件必然发生的事。
但我的收获更多在临终医疗，护理和养老。和美国社会不同，我爸爸妈妈觉得老了和子女一起生活是很正常的，在养老院度过很悲惨很孤独。社会结构和背景，医疗资源等等因素决定了人们的想法。体面的老去。人的尊严。
“Death ends a life, not a relationship.”
“As you grow, you learn more. Aging is not just decay…it’s growth. It’s more than the negative that you’re going to die, it’s also the positive that you understand that you’re going to die, and that you live a better life because of it.” --><br>✨<strong>Normal People(Sally Rooney)</strong><br><!--Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling that close with anyone. Marianne and Connell found it from each other, even though I could not completely comprehend their love. I like how small things in life are accounted in the book, those scenes like just a leaf on the floor, an unconcious action, etc. I am obssessive with sensitive descriptions, and sensitive hearts too, which can always find out little unvisible sparklings. In some way I am feeling so related to Marianna, drowning in a sea of emotion. I feel not myself at the moment. Not in a bad way. I just feel outside of my life. There is something comforting. Something good about feeling sort of numb, detached from it all. I don't find it obvious what people want. I don't want to fit in anywhere. I belong nowhere. --></p>
<p>✨<strong>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance(Robert M. Pirsig)</strong><br><!--Last time I read this book was couple years ago. I was not able to resonate at all, holding a naturally romatic personality, it bored me so much that I wanted to quit the reading many times. But this time this book did bring me more insights. 你必须先压制住自己的看法,否则你就无法读下去, 它是一个比沟里的死水还要沉闷的东西, 你会读到化油器, 齿轮, 压缩里等等,活塞,火花塞,进气等等, 如果从浪漫的角度来看就会觉得非常沉闷,丑陋而且十分笨拙,浪漫的人很少能突破这一点.  “You’ve got to live right, too. It’s the way you live that predisposes you to avoid the traps and see the right facts. You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It’s easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally. That’s the way all the experts do it. The making of a painting or the fixing of a motorcycle isn’t separate from the rest of your existence. If you’re a sloppy thinker the six days of the week you aren’t working on your machine, what trap avoidance, what gimmicks, can make you all of a sudden sharp on the seventh? It all goes together ... The real cycle you're working in is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be "out there" and the person that appears to be "in here" are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away from Quality together.”
如果你直接面对一个疯子,你所了解的就是他疯了, 这等于是根本不了解他. 要了解他,你就必须从他的角度看事情.
不可以在大太阳下直接修理车子,或者在你累了一整天下来脑筋不清楚的时候修理.
“When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things.” “If your mind is truly, profoundly stuck, then it might be much better off than when it was loaded with ideas” 精确的仪器是为了表达一种理念而设计的.约翰认为我接触到的是各种零件,实际我接触的是各种观念.
“Who really can face the future? All you can do is project from the past, even when the past shows that such projections are often wrong. And who really can forget the past? What else is there to know?” The TV scientist who mutters sadly, "The experiment is a failure; we have failed to achieve what we had hoped for," is suffering mainly from a bad script writer. An experiment is never a failure solely because it fails to achieve predicted results. An experiment is a failure only when it also fails adequately to test the hypothesis in question, when the data it produces don't prove anything one way or another.
“Definitions are the foundation of reason. You can’t reason without them.”
Although motorcycle riding is romantic, motorcycle maintenance is purely classic. “The real purpose of the scientific method is to make sure nature hasn’t misled you into thinking you know something you actually don’t know.”
“(What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its strangeness but its usualness).Familiarity can blind you too.” “You want to know how to paint a perfect painting? It's easy. Make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally.”
“We have artists with no scientific knowledge and scientists with no
artistic knowledge and both with no spiritual sense of gravity at all,
and the result is not just bad, it is ghastly.
“Familiarity can blind you”--></p>
<p>✨<strong>告别的仪式 (A Farewell to Sartre)(Simone de Beauvoir)</strong><br><!--Simone de Beauvoir's first-person account of the last ten years of Sartre's life. I used to describe them as Deliciously Complex. I also doubted their relationship maliciously. Satre, as a great philosopher, was so bossy and clever that he always made me feel their love was somehow not mutual. de Beauvoir may not be the only lover of Sartre, but she was definitely the most special and treasured one in his life. I decided not to question anymore because we human beings are just cutely vulnerable.--></p>
<p>✨<strong>Kim Ji-young: Born 1982(Cho Nam-joo)</strong><br><!--A story about a stay-at-home Korean mother driven to a psychotic break. I wasn’t as impressed with it as I thought I’d be because I've seen more terrible and cruel reality. I've never been a femilist, not been treated or hurt like that either, thanks to my family. But I grew up from an environment where everyone 实话说没有很深的感觉，因为我看过更悲痛的真实。我不是女性主义者，说实话也没有受到太强的伤害在这方面得益于我的家庭。但总体而言，我生长在一个对女性更加恶劣的环境和地区，见证了我从小周围几乎所有的女性都是家庭主妇包括我的妈妈，很多女生都没有自由支配自己的权利和能力。 We can say it's stale and platitudes just because it's being mentioned so many times. “There's this primary America of freeways and jet flights and TV and movie spectaculars, and people caught up in this primary America seem to go through huge portions of their lives without much consciousness of what immediately surrounds them. The media have convinced them that what's right around them is unimportant. And that's why they're lonely. “What was behind this smug presumption that what pleased you was bad or at least unimportant in comparison to other things? … Little children were trained not to do “just what they liked’ but … but what? … Of course! What others liked. And which others? Parents, teachers, supervisors, policemen, judges, officials, kings, dictators. All authorities. When you are trained to despise “just what you like” then, of course, you become a much more obedient servant of others -- a good slave. When you learn not to do “just what you like” then the System loves you.”--><br>✨<strong>Educated(Tara Westover)</strong><br><!--I run into Tara's life in this way. She grew up in a devout Mormon family in Iowa with her six siblings. Not trusting the government, their parents have been resisting hospitals, schools and all other public institutes. What they were doing daily was to prepare for the end of the world. Tara was like being in a dark isolated box, with a tiny hole to look at the outside. She did not know, that hole was made for her,  and what she was seeing was not everything. Finally at the age of 17, magically, all learning by herself, she passed the examination and entered Brigham Young University. Education gave a second birth to her. With a wholenew perspective, she revisited everything happened in her life: her father's psychological problems, her mother's ignorance and weakness, her brother's violence to her.  This book brought up a broad range of topics and questions about mainstream and margin--><br>✨<strong>And Then There Were None(Agatha Christie)</strong><br><!--Haven't read detective fictions for long. This one is just, classic. Not another word of it.  (I figured out who's the murderer halfway though)--><br>✨<strong>She said(Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey)</strong></p>
<p>✨<strong>Essays in Love(Alain de Botton)</strong><br><!--Must being in love always mean being in pain?--><br>✨<strong>Good Economics for hard times(Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo)</strong><br><!--Top 1 of my year. --></p>
<p>✨<strong>Tuesdays with Morrie(Mitch Albom)</strong><br><!--Read this through Audible in all my skateboarding time.   
"Detachment doesn’t mean you don’t let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That’s how you are able to leave it."
“Don’t cling to things because everything is impermanent.”
“The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it.”--></p>
<p>✨<strong>Becoming(Renaada Williams)</strong><br><!--Poems writtern for broken hearts. I've read it many times, deeply moved by those beautiful, touching and curing words. "It took a lot for me to get to this point to come to the realization to know what I want to feel what I feel without second guessing to become who I am without any question." "You have to be the light for yourself even when nobody else see it." "I've been in so many pieces enough times to know how to put myself together again."--></p>
<p>✨<strong>冬泳(班宇)</strong><br><!-- 最喜欢的一篇是空中道路。浪漫主义 谈及华而不实的梦想
荒诞 个人和时代 超写实 两个中年男人的友谊 这是多么悠长的一个夜晚，他们两手空空，陡然轻松，走在梦境里，走在天上，甚至无需背负影子的重量。 --></p>
